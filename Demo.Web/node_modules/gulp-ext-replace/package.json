  "readme": "# gulp-ext-replace\n\nSmall gulp 3 plugin to change file extensions.\n\n### Update - v0.2.0\n\nI've added a feature that allows you to tell this plugin what extension you want replaced instead of relying on Node.js to figure it out, which is always just the characters from the last period forward. See below for an example.\n\n## Install\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-ext-replace\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar ext_replace = require('gulp-ext-replace');\n\ngulp.task('change', function() {\n  gulp.src('styles/*.css')\n      .pipe(ext_replace('.scss'))\n      .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))\n});\n```\n\nIf you have a slightly more involved extension you'd like to replace like `.min.css`, you can tell the plugin to replace that instead of the default behavior by passing in a second variable to `ext_replace` in the following example:\n\n```javascript\ngulp.task('change', function() {\n  gulp.src('styles/*.css')\n      .pipe(ext_replace('.scss', '.min.css'))\n      .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))\n});\n```\n\n\n## Testing\n\nOpen a terminal in the directory containing `gulp-ext-replace` and then:\n\n```shell\nnpm install\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Change Log\n\n#### 0.2.0\n  - Added ability to specify the extension to be replaced\n  - Updated tests to test for `undefined`, `false` or blank extensions\n  - Added check for period at beginning of new extension\n  - Updated version of dependency `through2`\n\n#### 0.1.0\n  - Bug fix: typo in README\n  - Bumped version number\n\n#### 0.0.5\n  - Initial release\n\n\n## The License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2015 TJ Eastmond\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
